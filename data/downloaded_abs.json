Our group found a variant with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the IL13 gene at position +2044G>A (rs20541) that was expected to result in the non-conservative replacement of a positively charged arginine (R) with a neutral glutamine (Q) at position 144. IL-13Q144 was associated with augmented allergic airway inflammation and bronchial asthma remodeling. There is some indication that anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibodies can demonstrate a positive effect on the clinical course of refractory asthmatic patients. To date, the binding stability of these agents for IL-13Q144 is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the prediction efficacy of the anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibodies tralokinumab and lebrikizumab in asthmatic patients with IL-13R144 and IL-13Q144. The three-dimensional (3-D) structure of tralokinumab was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 5L6Y), and the complete 3-D structure of lebrikizumab was built through homology modeling. For the binding stability analysis, we performed and analyzed docking simulations of IL-13 with tralokinumab or lebrikizumab. The tralokinumab and lebrikizumab structures changed after binding to IL-13 to facilitate binding with IL-13Q144. The stability analysis with tralokinumab and lebrikizumab demonstrated that IL-13Q144 was more stable than IL-13R144 for both the Rosetta energy score and for the free energy of binding. IL-13Q144 might be a promising predictor of responsiveness to tralokinumab and lebrikizumab treatment for bronchial asthma."], ["Severe asthma in children is a heterogeneous disorder associated with variable responses to corticosteroid treatment.

To identify plasma biomarkers for the prediction of AERD, the six most abundant plasma proteins (albumin, IgG, antitrypsin, IgA, transferrin, and haptoglobin) in pooled plasma samples were removed using a multiple affinity removal system column. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) was used for differential display proteomic analysis of the pooled plasma. Proteins were identified by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)/TOF. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to identify and quantify apolipoprotein H (Apo H) in plasma from subjects with AERD and aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA). Eight protein spots showed differences in relative intensity between pooled plasma from subjects with AERD (n\u00a0=\u00a08) and those with ATA (n\u00a0=\u00a08). MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis showed decreases in the levels of alpha-fibrinogen precursor, Apo H, fibrin beta, and proapolipoprotein in AERD as compared with ATA, and increases in chain A human complement component C3, 90-kDa heat shock protein, complement component C4a, and kininogen-1 isoform 2. Apo H concentrations were significantly increased in plasma from subjects with ATA than those with AERD and normal controls, as measured by ELISA (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). AERD is characterized by changes in the levels of proteins involved in the coagulation and complement pathways.

This is not surprising, given that one-third of older people experience significant breathlessness. The differential diagnosis commonly includes asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, malignancy, aspiration and infections. Because symptoms and signs of several cardiorespiratory diseases are nonspecific in older people and diseases commonly co-exist, investigations are important. A simple strategy for the investigation of breathlessness in older people should include a full blood count, chest radiograph, ECG, peak flow diary and/or spirometry with reversibility as a minimum. If there are major abnormalities on the ECG, an echocardiogram should also be performed. Diurnal variability in peak flow readings >or=20% or >or=15% reversibility in forced expiratory volume in 1 second, spontaneously or with treatment, support a diagnosis of asthma. Distinguishing asthma from COPD is important to allow appropriate management of disease based on aetiology, accurate prediction of treatment response, correct prognosis and appropriate management of the chest condition and co-morbidities. The two conditions are usually readily differentiated by clinical features, particularly age at onset, variability of symptoms and nocturnal symptoms in asthma, supported by the results of reversibility testing. Full lung function tests may not necessarily help in differentiating the two entities, although gas transfer factor is characteristically reduced in COPD and usually normal or high in asthma. Methacholine challenge tests previously mainly used in research are now also used widely and safely to confirm asthma in clinical settings. Interest in exhaled nitric oxide as a biomarker of airways inflammation is increasing as a noninvasive tool in the diagnosis and monitoring of asthma. Regular inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay of treatment of asthma. Even in mild disease in older adults, regular preventive treatment should be considered, given the poor perception of bronchoconstriction by older asthmatic patients. If symptoms persist despite ICS, addition of long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) should be considered. Addition of LABA to ICS improves asthma control and allows reduction in ICS dose. However, older people have been grossly under-represented in trials of LABA, many trials having excluded those >or=65 years of age. On meta-analysis, beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists (both short acting and long acting) are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in asthma and COPD. While the evidence for excess cardiovascular mortality is stronger for short-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists, it would be prudent to exercise particular care in using beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists (long acting and short acting) in those at risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including older people. Regular review of cardiovascular status (and monitoring of serum potassium concentration) in patients taking beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists is crucial. The response to LABA should be carefully monitored and alternative 'add-on' therapy such as leukotriene receptor antagonists (LRA) should be considered. LRA have fewer adverse effects and in individual cases may be more effective and appropriate than LABA. Long-term trials evaluating beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists and other bronchodilator strategies are needed particularly in the elderly and in patients with cardiovascular co-morbidities. There is no evidence that addition of anticholinergics improves control of asthma further, although the role of long-acting anticholinergics in the prevention of disease progression is currently being researched. Older patients need to be taught good inhaler technique to improve delivery of medications to lungs, minimise adverse effects and reduce the need for oral corticosteroids.

EMT had dramatic effects on the induction of the innate pathway and the coupling interval of the canonical and noncanonical NF- \u03ba B pathways. Simulation experiments demonstrate that rapid, coordinated cap-independent translation of TRAF-1 and NF- \u03ba B2 is required to reduce the noncanonical pathway coupling interval. Experiments using amantadine confirmed the prediction that TRAF-1 and NF- \u03ba B2/p100 production is mediated by an IRES-dependent mechanism. These data indicate that the epigenetic changes produced by EMT induce dynamic state changes of the innate signaling pathway. Further applications of systems approaches will provide understanding of this complex phenotype through deterministic modeling and multidimensional (genomic and proteomic) profiling."], ["Bronchodilator response tests measure the effect of beta(2)-agonists, the most commonly used short-acting reliever drugs for asthma.

This type of studies has been very successful in the case of Mendelian monogenic disorders while it has been less successful in identifying genetic variants related to complex diseases where the insurgence depends on the interactions between different genes and the environment. The current technology allows to genotype more than a million of markers and this number has been rapidly increasing in the last years with the imputation based on templates sets and whole genome sequencing. This type of data introduces a great amount of noise in the statistical analysis and usually requires a great number of samples. Current methods seldom take into account gene-gene and gene-environment interactions which are fundamental especially in complex diseases. In this paper we propose to use a non-parametric additive model to detect the genetic variants related to diseases which accounts for interactions of unknown order. Although this is not new to the current literature, we show that in an isolated population, where the most related subjects share also most of their genetic code, the use of additive models may be improved if the available genealogical tree is taken into account.

This procedure has been successfully used for the beta-thalassemia, which is a well known Mendelian disease, and also to the common asthma where we have identified candidate genes that underlie to the susceptibility of the asthma. Some of such candidate genes have been also found related to common asthma in the current literature.", "The data analysis approach, based on selecting the most related cases and controls along with the Random Forest model, is a powerful tool for detecting genetic variants associated to a disease in isolated populations. Moreover, this method provides also a prediction model that has accuracy in estimating the unknown disease status and that can be generally used to build kit tests for a wide class of Mendelian diseases."], ["Effective management of populations with asthma requires methods for identifying patients at high risk for adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to develop and validate prediction models that used computerized utilization data from a large health-maintenance organization (HMO) to predict asthma-related hospitalization and emergency department (ED) visits.

Classification trees identified previous hospitalization and ED visits, six or more beta-agonist inhalers (units) during the prior 6 mo, and three or more physicians prescribing asthma medications during the prior 6 mo as predictors. The classification trees performed similarly to proportional-hazards models, and identified patients who had a threefold greater risk of hospitalization and a twofold greater risk of ED visits than the average patient.

Values of EC50 (drug concentration that gives the half-maximum bronchodilator effect) in the in vitro studies based on isolated trachea of guinea pigs were collected from the literature. The ratios of the EC50 value of each drug to that of isoproterenol were used as the indicator of in vitro pharmacological activity. There were significant correlations between the EC50 ratios and the oral dose or the maximum plasma concentration after single oral administration, but the correlation coefficients were relatively small (r < .9).

The present study investigated whether alpha predicts clinical response to beta(2)-agonist treatment, taking into account other conventional predictors. Analysis was performed on previously published twice-daily peak expiratory flow measurements in 66 asthmatic adults over three 6-month randomised order treatment periods: placebo, salbutamol and salmeterol.

The current authors found that alpha measured during the placebo period considerably improved the prediction of response to salmeterol treatment, taking into account genotype, lung function or its variability, or airway hyperresponsiveness.

Young females (21 yr +/- 1.9) diagnosed with mild asthma (N = 25) were compared with females having normal lung function (N = 25) matched for age, VO2peak, trait anxiety, activity history (7-d recall), and BMI (kg.m-2). Relative oxygen consumption (%VO2peak), blood lactate concentration, VE.VO2(-1), and state anxiety were statistically controlled in hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses. For each group, %VO2peak explained 60% of the variance in RPE across power outputs (P less than 0.001); R2 was unchanged (P greater than 0.10) with the addition of blood lactate, VE.VO2(-1), and state anxiety. Absolute RPE and BRE did not differ between groups at any power output, but partial standardized (beta) and unstandardized (b) regression coefficients and increases in R2 showed that BRE had a greater effect (P less than 0.01) on RPE for asthmatics [adjusted R2 increased to 0.89; (beta) = 0.75; (b) = 0.79 +/- 0.06] than for controls [adjusted R2 increased to 0.74; (beta) = 0.52; (b) = 0.51 +/- 0.09].

The aim of this study was to simulate the deposition distribution of both components of this drug within the airways based on realistic airflow measurements. Breathing parameters of 25 healthy adults (11 females and 14 males) were acquired while inhaling through Turbuhaler(\u00ae). Individual specific emitted doses and particle size distributions of Symbicort(\u00ae) Turbuhaler(\u00ae) were determined. A self-developed particle deposition model was adapted and validated to simulate the deposition of budesonide (inhaled corticosteroid; ICS) and formoterol (long acting \u03b22 agonist; LABA) in the upper airways and lungs of the healthy volunteers. Based on current simulations the emitted doses varied between 50.4% and 92.5% of the metered dose for the ICS, and between 38% and 96.1% in case of LABA component depending on the individual inhalation flow rate. This variability induced a notable inter-individual spread of the deposited lung doses (mean: 33.6%, range: 20.4%-48.8% for budesonide and mean: 29.8%, range: 16.4%-42.9% for formoterol). Significant inter-gender differences were also observed. Average lung dose of budesonide was 29.2% of the metered dose for females and 37% for males, while formoterol deposited with 26.4% efficiency for females and 32.5% for males. Present results also highlighted the importance of breath-holding after inhalation of the drug. About a half of the total lung deposition occurred during breath-hold at 9.6s average breath-hold time. Calculated depositions confirmed appropriate lung deposition of Symbicort(\u00ae) Turbuhaler(\u00ae) for both genders, however more effort for optimal inhalation technique is advised for persons with low vital capacity.

However, there was no correlation between cord and maternal serum sFc epsilon R2, suggesting that most, if not all, of cord serum sFc epsilon R2 was produced by the fetus itself. Cord serum sFc epsilon R2 in infants who developed atopic symptoms later was significantly higher than that in infants who were free of atopic symptoms (P less than 0.01 at 7 and 13 months of age). The incidence of the development of atopic symptoms increased with the increase of cord serum sFc epsilon R2.

In asthmatics and normals the changes in serum terbutaline levels and plasma cAMP levels were closely correlated and in the same range. No change in lung function parameters was registered in normals, whereas in asthmatics a significant improvement was shown. In asthmatics all lung function parameters closely parallelled the changes in serum terbutaline concentrations and cAMP plasma concentrations, the FEV1 being the least variable lung function parameter. The maximal effect in FEV1 occurred 30-60 min after the subcutaneous dose and 2-4 h after the oral dose. The FEV1 improvement showed a linear relationship with the serum terbutaline concentration between 1.6 and 6 ng/ml. In contrast with theophyllines and anticholinergics, serum terbutaline concentrations showed a very low interindividual variance. Nevertheless it appeared that prediction of a certain improvement in lung function was not possible on the basis of the serum concentration. Since changes in plasma cAMP values after terbutaline therapy were similar in normals and asthmatics, the lung function improvement in the asthmatics suggests that if a beta-adrenergic defect exists, this must be mainly situated in the lung tissue."], ["Human plasma platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase functions by reducing PAF levels as a general anti-inflammatory scavenger and is linked to anaphylactic shock, asthma, and allergic reactions. The enzyme has also been implicated in hydrolytic activities of other pro-inflammatory agents, such as sn-2 oxidatively fragmented phospholipids. This plasma enzyme is tightly bound to low and high density lipoprotein particles and is also referred to as lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2. The crystal structure of this enzyme has been solved from x-ray diffraction data collected to a resolution of 1.5 angstroms. It has a classic lipase alpha/beta-hydrolase fold, and it contains a catalytic triad of Ser273, His351, and Asp296. Two clusters of hydrophobic residues define the probable interface-binding region, and a prediction is given of how the enzyme is bound to lipoproteins. Additionally, an acidic patch of 10 carboxylate residues and a neighboring basic patch of three residues are suggested to play a role in high density lipoprotein/low density lipoprotein partitioning. A crystal structure is also presented of PAF acetylhydrolase reacted with the organophosphate compound paraoxon via its active site Ser273. The resulting diethyl phosphoryl complex was used to model the tetrahedral intermediate of the substrate PAF to the active site.

Several mechanisms are involved but it seems to be exceptional that there is an IgE-dependent reaction. There is no paraclinical examination for diagnosis or prediction of reactions. There are hyperosmolar ICPs and others, more recent, which are non-ionic, of reduced osmolality. Non-ionic ICPs induce only a quarter of the secondary reactions of all types together and the reactions are often less severe.

Typically, biomarkers are used currently to provide mechanistic insight or an objective measure of disease severity, with their future role in risk stratification/disease prediction speculative at best. There are many lessons to be learned from the biomarker strategies used for cancer in which biomarkers are in routine clinical use and industry-wide standardized approaches have been developed. Biomarker discovery and validation in children with disease lag behind those in adults; given the early onset and therefore potential lifelong effect of many NCDs, there should be more studies incorporating cohorts of children. Many pediatric biomarkers are at the discovery stage, with a long path to evaluation and clinical implementation. The ultimate challenge will be optimization of prevention strategies that can be implemented in children identified as being at risk of an NCD through the use of biomarkers."]]}
